* Project description
Function that are intended to be useful when working on symmetric
cryptography in C.

!INCLUDE! *\.[hc]

* Coding convention
** Modules
The functions are organized into modules. The names of the functions
in each module must start with =pi26_<module name>= where =<module
name>= is, for instance, =rand= for functions connected with
pseudo-random number generation. Each module must have a header =.h=
** Parameters
The parameters which are modified during the execution of a function
must be the first ones in the list. Parameters modified are
pointer(not references).
** Macros
Macros are uppercased and must also start with =PI26_<MODULE_NAME>=.
